This is basically a Two player Dice Game. In which it allows player 1 to roll the dice and every time he rolls the dice. It get added to his current score. After rolling everytime the player has a option either to hold his score or roll the dice again.If the player holds his score the dice will pass to player 2 and the player 1 gets the score he has rolled in total score. But if the player chooses to roll the dice and if he rolls the dice to 1, His current score would become 0, And the dice be passed to player 2. The winner would be the player whoever gets the "Total Score of 100 first"
